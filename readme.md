# Neural Network Intuition

**Learn neural networks from scratch using Spotify song recommendations. Pure Python + NumPy. No frameworks.**

---

## Overview

This series builds **deep, lasting intuition** for neural networks by implementing every concept **from first principles** — using **real Spotify audio features**:

- `danceability` (0–1)  
- `energy` (0–1)  
- `sadness` (0–1)  
- `tempo` (60–200 BPM)

A **neuron** = one music recommendation expert.  
A **layer** = a team of experts.  
A **batch** = multiple songs processed at once.

No PyTorch. No TensorFlow. Just **pure understanding**.
